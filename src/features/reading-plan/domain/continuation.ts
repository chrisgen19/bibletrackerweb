 *
 * - never before the day after the logged date, so the logged day keeps its own
 *   history and the calendar does not shift underneath it;
 * - never in the past, so days that have already elapsed are not rewritten;
 * - never on a day that already has a completion. Skipping that last case would
 *   park the next chapter on a day the user has already ticked off, and the day
 *   after would advance past it — silently consuming a chapter they never read.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is nothing to continue to, i.e. the user logged the
 * final chapter of the canon.
